## 📖 Overview

In this notebook, we will reproduce key indicators of climate change, similar to NASA's <https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs>.  One of our primary objectives is to reproduce the famous 'hockey-stick' curve first reported in _Nature_ ([Mann et al 1998](https://doi.org/10.1038/33859 "Mann, M., Bradley, R. & Hughes, M. Global-scale temperature patterns and climate forcing over the past six centuries. Nature 392, 779–787 (1998). https://doi.org/10.1038/33859")) using the most recent observations and most extensive ice core data. We will also explore other consequences of climate change using data on ice sheet mass, sea level rise, and ice sheet coverage.
